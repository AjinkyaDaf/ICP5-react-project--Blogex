                    Tea is the most popular beverage in the world after water.
                    It’s a simple preparation of pouring hot water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant.
                    The first recording of tea described it as a medicinal beverage in China in the 3rd century AD.
                    Merchants helped its popularity to spread quickly across continents.
                    In the early 19th century, Great Britain popularized the concept of afternoon tea,
                    a break from one’s routine in which tea is served alongside sandwiches and baked goods such as scones.
                    The flavor of tea varies by where the tea leaves are harvested and how they are grown and processed.
                    Black tea is the most popular worldwide, followed by green, oolong, and white tea
